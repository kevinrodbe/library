  # Creating our First Router
  #
  # Instructions:
  # 
  # Dr. Goodparts wants to add a link next to each appointment
  # that will take him to a new page that will show just
  # that single appointment.  Easy enough.
  #
  # But he wants it to be super-snappy and use the new HTML5 pushState
  # API (he's strangely knowledgable of web-trends for a doctor).
  #
  # Go ahead and create a new Backbone Router and name it AppRouter.
  #
  # Initial Code

  # Answer:
  `var AppRouter = Backbone.Router.extend({});`

  # need this or coffeescript will produce a js syntax error
  this
