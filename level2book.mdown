#### Autolayout

Auto layout is a constraint based, descriptive layout system.  Hardcoded layout is like CGRect.

Button is centered horizontally in it's superview, a fixed distance from the bottom.

Constraints are equations:

Button.centerX = Superview.centerX
Button.bottom = Superview.bottom - padding
