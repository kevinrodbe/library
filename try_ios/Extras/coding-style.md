# Coding Style

Take a little pride in the code you write. Even if you know that nobody else will evey see it, there's something going on, deep down, psychologically when you write neatly. It's like having a clean house - it just makes you feel better and in turn you end up being more productive. In addition, unless you are a secluded hipster app developer, someone is eventually going to see your code.

## Be Verbose

One thing you'll learn to appreciate about Objective-C is that it tends to favor verbosity. In a way, it forces developers to write good method names.

## Be Consistent

Once little quirk in Xcode is that IBActions methods are auto-generated differently than regular class methods:

See those brackets? No big deal, it's easy to change themâ€¦ just don't pick up the habit. Throwing brackets around everywhere is kind of like experimenting with drugs*. You think it's harmless until you wake up one day and realize you have an utter lack of self control. You will then think of the people reading your code and will be grieved.

TODO: Put some thought into your APIs. Be consistent with them.

Whatever you do, try to be consistent with your community.

Always be consistent with yourself.
