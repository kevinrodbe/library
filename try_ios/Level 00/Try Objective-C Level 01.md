# Try Objective-C - Level 01

## What is Objective-C

Quick Facts

* Objective-C is the primary language for developing Mac and iOS applications.
* Objective-C is a super-set of C. It literally means "C Objectified", or "Object Oriented C".
* Any C program can be compiled using an Objective-C compiler.
* Objective-C lends itself to being **verbose**. Clarity and consistency are important.

## Getting Started

One of the trickiest parts of understanding and becoming fluent in Objective-C is knowing when to use standard C code and when to use Objective-C.  Let's start with a little C.

### Statements

Each line of code in Objective-C is called a statement, and each statement ends with  a semicolon `;`, just like how each sentence in the English language ends with a period.

### Integers and Variables in C

Objective-C is a strongly-typed language, which means that you have to declare data types for your variables.

One of the simplest data types is `int`, which stores an integer.

* Type `int yourNum = "5";`

Congratulations, you just created your first variable!

Here's another variable we created for you: `int ourNum = "10";`

* Create a variable of type `int` called **sum**, and set it equal to **yourNum** plus **ourNum**

* Create a variable of type `int` called **difference**, and set it equal to **yourNum** minus **ourNum**

### Logging in C

To see the value of a variable in C you can use the `printf` function and pass the name of the variable and a formatting string that represents the data type of the variable you are trying to print to the console.  For example, to print the integer in the variable **yourNum**, you would type `printf("%d", yourNum);`

* Type `printf("%d", yourNum);`

Formatting strings are great, because they allow you to easily output several different values are once, and include helpful strings that keep the output organized.  For example, let's refactor the last statement to read `printf("The value of yourNum is: %d", yourNum);`

* Type `printf("The value of yourNum is: %d", yourNum);`

There are tons of different formatting strings, like `d`, `i`, `f`, `c`, `s`, and `p` just to name a few, and if you need to output more than one variable, just include multiple formatting strings and add the variable names as additional function arguments in the order that they appear in your output string.

	* print the message "yourNum is <yourNum> and ourNum is <ourNum> and their sum is <sum>, replacing the information in between the <brackets> with the values of those variables

### Integers and Variables in Objective-C

While not always true, you can be pretty sure you're working with Objective-C classes if you see data types starting with NS.  NS is short for NeXTStep, the OS developed by NeXT, which was purchased by Apple and eventually grew into OS X, which of course heavily influenced iOS. That's right, all of those NS's you see are remnants from those early versions.

**NSNumber** is a Class that can be used to manage any Objective-C primitive numeric data type.

Working with a Class that holds numeric data is conceptually similar to working with a primitive data type that holds numeric data, but the syntax of the required code looks very different.


#### Creating and Initializing Objects in Objective-C

There are usually 3 steps to creating objects in Objective-C

1. Allocate memory and initialize the object.
2. Set the initial state of the object by modifying properties (if necessary).
3. Set the initial value of the object.

Allocating memory is as simple as passing the `alloc` message to the Class of the object.  For example, if you want to allocate memory for an object of type NSData, you would pass the NSData Class the `alloc` message, like this: `[NSData alloc]`. Allocating memory is only half the battle - now that you have memory allocated for your new object, you have to initialize it.

The way to initialize an object is to pass your [ClassName alloc] the message `init`, and that's usually done all it one step, like this: `[[ClassName  alloc] init];`

* Try allocating and initializing (alloc/initing) an NSNumber object.

Now you've got your object, storing it should be as simple as following the pattern we established with primitive data types, right?  Right!?#$!#

* Go ahead, declare a variable named `age` of type `NSNumber` and set it equal to your alloc/init'd object.  We dare you.

ERRRORRRRRRRRRR `Interface type cannot be statically allocated`

It sounds complicated, but it's a pretty generic error message that in this case has to do with only one tiny, yet very important, mistake in our syntax.  To understand that mistake, we need to talk about pointers.

### Pointers

A pointer is a reference to a spot in memory.  To declare a pointer, put a `*` in between the data type and variable name.  You'll see it written a few different ways, but they all mean the same thing:

	int* sum;
	int * sum;
	int *sum;

* Try declaring a pointer to a variable named `sum` of type **NSNumber**.

When you declare your variable as a pointer and then create an object.  You are actually storing a reference to the memory location of your object, but **not the object itself**.

This is an important feature, because objects can get really big and slow to pass around to different parts of your program, but memory references are always really small and can be swiftly passed around.

Once you create a variable as a pointer, you can interact with it just like you would a normal variable, but always keep it in the back of your mind that you are modifying  your initialized object via a pointer (passing by reference).

* With that knowledge, create two pointers to variables of type NSNumber

### Mutability and Initializers

Mutable is just a fancy word that means "this can change after being initialized," and likewise immutable means "this cannot change after being initialized". Most NS-prefixed Classes are immutable, meaning that they cannot be changed once they are initialized.

So, you just alloc/init'd an NSNumber object, and now you want to set the value.  Not so fast, buddy!  NSNumber is an immutable Class, and instantiation creates an immutable object.  Your best and only approach when dealing with immutable Classes is to use a custom initializer that is undoubtedly bundled with that Class.  NSNumber has several: `initWithBool:`, `initWithFloat:`, and `initWithInt:` (among others).  `initWithInt:` sounds like it will work great for this example!  The `initWithInt:` message gets sent to an allocated NSNumber object and gets passed one argument - the int that you want to be the value of your NSNumber object.

* Create a pointer to a variable named `ourNum` of type NSNumber, and initialize that object with the integer value `5`.

* Create another pointer to a variable named `yourNum` of type NSNumber, and initialize that object with the integer value `10	`.

You can access the value of an NSNumber object by passing it the message `intValue`.

* Try logging out the value of `yourNum` to the console.  `[yourNum intValue];`

* Finally, create a pointer to an object of type `NSNumber` called `sum`, and initialize the value of `sum` to the intValue of `ourNum` plus the intValue of `yourNum`.

Great!  You've got a pointer to an NSNumber object that contains the sum of ourNum and yourNum.  Now just go ahead and log that out to the console using that trusty printf functionâ€¦
