## Challenge 2

### Video

We added a new `@property` to our `InstaPhotoPost` model called `isPopularPost` which denotes that the particular post has been liked more than 25 times.

```
TODO: Show changes we made to the model hereâ€¦
```

We've also updated our table cells to have this little "Popular" badge which is hidden by default:

> TODO: Show updated table cell picture.

Let's update our code to show the "popular" badge on posts that are popular.

### Challenge Instruction

Update the `FeedViewController` to check if the current cell `isTrending`. If the cell `isTrending`, show the cell's `trendingBadge` image view by using `setHidden:`.
